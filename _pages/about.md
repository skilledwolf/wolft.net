I am a postdoctoral researcher in the field of condensed matter physics, currently in the group of [Prof. Allan MacDonald](https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~macdgrp/) at the [Center for Complex Quantum Systems](http://order.ph.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I earned a doctorate at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://itp.phys.ethz.ch/) of ETH Zürich for my research and dissertation on ``Electronic properties of twisted-layer graphene systems`` advised by [Prof. Gianni Blatter](https://itp.phys.ethz.ch/research/condmat/vortex.html) and [Prof. Oded Zilberberg](https://www.zilberberg.uni-konstanz.de/home/).

My research focuses on electronic properties and light-matter interactions in two-dimensional materials that result from stacking atomically-thin crystals, such as graphene, hexa-boron nitride and transition-metal dichalcogenides. Stacking these materials leads to novel emergent properties, such as moiré structures with geometrically-tunable flat bands, unusual band topology, and correlated phases such as (spin--valley) magnetism and superconductivity, and anomalous (fractional) quantum Hall physics. Understanding the effects of electronic interactions and predicting correlated phases accurately is a long-standing problem, and two-dimensional materials are proving to be a versatile platform to address this challenge. In my research, I use accurate band structure models, Hartree-Fock mean-field calculations and develop new beyond-mean-field methods building on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation to qualitatively and quantitatively predict electronic properties of multilayers. To this end, I develop my own state-of-the-art numerical implementations and make use of high-performance computational strategies.
